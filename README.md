Eat-Da-Burger


In this app we use node express to run a server on port 8080. The user can enter a burger they want and it will display to the screen. Then they can click a button to devour it. 

In this app we use handlebars to diaplay the data to the screen. 
We are using mySQL to on the backend to store the data so you can make your burger today and devour it on tuesday!
